Welcome to the Real Links Engineering Blog. Weâ€™re working hard to bring your employee referrals platform to life! Over the course of the next few months weâ€™re going to be breaking down certain aspects of the platform & architecture to share what weâ€™ve learnt!

We've been building our core product for over a year now, split into three core components: A backend GraphQL API, a frontend Vue app & a collection of backend Serverless services. We'll be pulling the curtain back & diving into these individual services over the year, explaining some of the pros & cons of the frameworks we've chosen.

Topics in the future you can expect to read about:

- Building a product GraphQL-first.
- End-to-end testing with Cypress.
- Vue Server-Side Rendering.
- Cognito & building Administration.

There are also a few utilities in our codebase that we are going to abstract out & share with the community - including useful tricks & shortcuts around form generation, control flow & error handling. Weâ€™re also going to link to other articles that we found useful whilst building our product, optionally with some commentary. Stay tuned!
