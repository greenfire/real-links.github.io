Welcome to the Real Links Engineering Blog. We’re working hard to bring your employee referrals platform to life! Over the course of the next few months we’re going to be breaking down certain aspects of the platform & architecture to share what we’ve learnt!

We've been building our core product for over a year now, split into three core components: A backend GraphQL API, a frontend Vue app & a collection of backend Serverless services. We'll be pulling the curtain back & diving into these individual services over the year, explaining some of the pros & cons of the frameworks we've chosen.

Topics in the future you can expect to read about:

- Building a product GraphQL-first.
- End-to-end testing with Cypress.
- Server-side rendering with Vue.
- Building Administration with Cognito.

There are also a few utilities in our codebase that we are going to abstract out & share with the community - useful tricks & shortcuts - around form generation, control flow & error handling.

We’re also going to link to other articles that we found useful, optionally with some commentary. Stay tuned!
